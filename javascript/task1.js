Task1:
Remove particular charactre and keep rest same.

Task2:
Luck Game
> You have generate one random number for 3 digit
> You have take input of 3 digit
> if user input and random number match than win else loose
SOLUTION :
var a = Math.floor(Math.random()*1000);
var b = prompt('Please enter a 3 digit number. If more than 3 is entered, then only first 3 will be accepted');
if(b.length != 3){
    b = b.substring(0, 3);
}
alert ('new value is ' + b);
if(b == a) {
 alert ('won');
}
else {
    alert ('die');
}


Task3:
(âˆš2 *6)/random*100
SOLUTION :
(Math.sqrt(2) * 6)/(Math.random()*100)

Task4:

    var user = ["john","stephen"]
